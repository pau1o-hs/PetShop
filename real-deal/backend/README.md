# Getting started

- Install Docker on your machine [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/].

- On terminal type `docker-compose up -d` to start de database.

- Run `npm install` and, after all modules have been downloaded, run `npm start`.

Use Postman to interact with the server and "MongoDB Compass" to check the Database.
Have fun!
